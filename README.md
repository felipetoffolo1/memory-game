# Awesome Memory Game
This is a classic memory game, the idea is just too have **fun** and use some **JS**.
It is all made with only html, js e css. No **third-party libs**

## How it works!
Basically the game has to maoin classes **Game** and **Card**
### Game
This is constructor is called every time we want to start a new Game.
In there are all the game properties, as start time,number of moves, etc..

### Cards
The Card class is used to add ao the Cards of the game. Each one with your icon and basic functions, as turn for example.
